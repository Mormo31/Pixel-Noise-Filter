# Pixel-Noise-Filter
This program reads and processes a numerical representation of a black-and-white image, converting the data into a pixel grid where numbers represent black or white pixels. It filters out noise by adjusting stray pixels that don't match their surrounding neighbors and outputs both the raw and cleaned-up versions of the image.
